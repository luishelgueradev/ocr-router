# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-23)

**Core value:** Never fail to return the best available text/data for a document — the cascade escalates quality automatically so one API call always yields the best result any configured engine could produce.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-23 — Roadmap created (4 phases, 38/38 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Dependency-ordered build — Foundation (port) → Cascade Router → Input Pipeline → Structured Extraction.
- [Roadmap]: Cascade built on plain images BEFORE the input pipeline (core value + lowest-dependency layer).
- [Roadmap]: Page-aware response envelope (`pages[]`) designed in Phase 1 even while image-only, or multi-page becomes a breaking change.
- [Roadmap]: OPS-01..05 folded into Phase 1 (ported deploy/foundation); OPS-06 lives in Phase 3 where sharp/native decoders land.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Confidence heuristic is the hardest-to-tune, highest-risk logic (false-good garbage detection). Research-flag: warrants a focused spike + small labeled calibration sample during planning.
- [Phase 2]: Ollama Cloud quota resets on 5h/7-day windows and burns fastest on the 235B model — confirm real quota numbers before finalizing the global budget cap.
- [Phase 3]: Subprocess sandboxing mechanics (memory/pid caps, clean kill) and HEIC-in-Docker (patched libheif) need validation against the target VPS/Docker setup. Research-flag.
